iTunesExport
===================
A Console App that parses an iTunes Library file and exports album data to a SQL CE database.
The first pass of the app writes the albums to a single table schema.
It relies on the iTunesLibraryParser project also on github.
The location of the iTunes Library file is specified in the exe's app.config.
